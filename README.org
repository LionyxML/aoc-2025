* Intro

This repository contains my personal solutions for the
[[https://adventofcode.com/2025][Advent of Code 2025]] challenges.

Advent of Code is an annual programming event created by Eric Wastl,
featuring a new set of algorithmic puzzles released every day from
December 1st to December 25th.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice problem solving and algorithmic thinking
- Experiment with different languages, styles, and approaches
- Keep a public and reproducible record of my solutions
- Have fun solving puzzles 🎄✨

* Structure

Each day has its own directory, usually named after the day number:

#+begin_example
01/
02/
03/
...
#+end_example

Inside each directory you may find:

- Source code for Part 1 and Part 2
- Notes or explanations (when relevant)

The exact structure may vary depending on the language or approach
used.

* Languages & Tools

The solutions here presented were originally made in =Rust= using =Emacs=.

There is no attempt to optimize for performance unless it is part of
the puzzle.  Clarity and experimentation are preferred over
micro-optimizations.

* Disclaimer

These solutions are written for learning and personal enjoyment.
They may not represent the most optimal or shortest possible answers.

If you are currently participating in Advent of Code, consider solving
the puzzles yourself before reading the solutions 🙂.
